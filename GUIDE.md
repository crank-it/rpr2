  | Phase               | Description                                             |
  |---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
  | Distributor Preview | Date when distributors get early access to the campaign |
  | Salon Launch        | Date when salons receive the campaign                   |
  | Consumer Launch     | Date when the campaign goes live for end consumers      |

  Why It's Useful

  This enables a staggered release strategy where:
  1. Distributors see the campaign first (preview period to prepare)
  2. Salons launch next (professional channel)
  3. Consumers launch last (public release)
